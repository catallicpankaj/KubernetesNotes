POD & Deployment
-----------------
basic deployable unit in Kubernetes
POD is mortal, ephemeral.
It gets deleted and new ip is assigned everytime, so we cannot rely on pods. 
It cant scale with itself, it means no replicas.
Pods - runs one or more closely related containers
Deployment - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number of them exist.

Pods:
----------
Runs a single set of containers
Good for one-off dev purposes
Rarely used directly in production
No rolling updates


Deployment:
-----------
Runs a set of identical pods
Monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary
Good for dev
Good for production
You can rollout and rollback your changes using deployment


Pod YAML FILE
=======
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: reactive-app-pod
  labels:
    tier: backend
    app: reactive-app-demok8s
spec:
  containers:
    - name: reactive-app
      image: catallicpankaj/reactiveapp1:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Never
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      env:
        - name: ENV
          value: dev
        - name: spring.profiles.active
          value: dev

Commands to create and get the details of PODs
----------	  
kubectl create -f reactive-app-pod.yaml
kubectl describe pods --namespace=test
