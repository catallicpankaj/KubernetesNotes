Steps to setup a cluster using kubeadm tool:
------
Have multiple virtual machines provisioned as Master and Worker Nodes
Once provision designate one as Master and other as Worker Ndoes.

Install container runtime, docker on all the nodes.

Install Kubeadm tool on all the nodes. This helps us to bootstrap the k8s solution by installing and configuring all the k8s components on right nodes in right order. 

Initialize Master server.

Before joining worker nodes on Master .. Network connections need to be managed. 
Master - Worker Node -- POD Network is required. that will help to communicate across

And then Join the node.. 




MASTER         			WORKER NODE1 				Workder Node 2
				     Join Node to Master         Join Node to Master

Initialize
